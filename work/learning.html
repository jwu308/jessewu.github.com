                <span class='heading'>Problem</span>
                <span class='body'>Each course in MongoDB University has a syllabus and progress page. The syllabus page shows a list of the chapter sections that make up the course, and the progress page shows students their current grades in the course.
                <br><br>
                    <img class='shadow' src='../img/learning/existing_syllabus.jpeg' />

                    <img class='shadow' src='../img/learning/existing_progress.jpeg' />
                <br><br>
               The MongoDB University team had been receiving questions and complaints regarding  these pages from users in the community. For example, many users often submitted reports regarding their confusion about:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grading policy</li>
                    <li>Current progress in the course</li>
                    <li>Homework deadlines</li>
                    <li>Countless other issues</li>
                </ul>
                <br>I was asked to investigate these usability issues with the syllabus and progress pages and create newly redesigned experiences to address the users' problems and increase user engagement during courses.

                <span class='heading'>Research</span>
                <span class='body'>To learn more about how users currently interact with the syllabus and progress pages and empathize with their paint points, needs, and goals when taking a MongoDB University course, two research methods were conducted: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interviews</li>
                    <li>Card Sorting</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                For the interviews, 11 users were asked a variety of open-ended questions about the context in which they complete MongoDB courses, their goals when taking courses, and issues with interacting with the syllabus and progress pages. These users primarily consisted of data administrators and developers.
                <br><br>
                For the card sorting activity, key pieces of information about courses, such as chapter titles, chapter start dates, and homework grades, were written on cards. The same 11 users were asked to organize these cards in order of important to them through three phases of taking a course: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browsing a course initially</li>
                    <li>Completing course work during the course</li>
                    <li>Evaluating results after the course has finished</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                After the user research was conducted and the results were synthesized, the main research insights were:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users have missed assignment deadlines or misinterpret grades, causing some users to fall behind and drop out of a course</li>
                    <li>In the beginning of a course, users would like to understand an overview of the course material as well as the time commitment needed to complete the course</li>
                    <li>During the middle of a course, users would like to easily access homework assignments, understand their progress in terms of lessons left to complete, and know their current grades</li>
                    <li>At the end of a course, users would like to understand their performance and access further resources to address areas of weakness and related areas of study</li>
                </ul>
                </span>
                <span class='heading'>Ideation and Early Design</span>
                <span class='body'>Based on the users' needs from the research insights, several primary user tasks were determined:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browse an overview of the course's material and chapter structure</li>
                    <li>Access homework assignments</li>
                    <li>Keep track the amount of completed work and incomplete work</li>
                    <li>Understand their grades</li>
                    <li>Refer to additional resources to improve areas of weakness or learn more about the course</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                To begin designing an experience that enables users to complete a multitude of user tasks, the tasks were organized into multiple categories. UI designs were then ideated via sketching for each of the categories resulting in several components and component layouts:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overall Layout</li>
                    <img src='../img/learning/ideation_layout.jpg' />
                    <li>Chapter Organization</li>
                    <img src='../img/learning/ideation_chapters.jpg' />
                    <li>Course Progress</li>
                    <img src='../img/learning/ideation_progress.jpg' />
                    <li>Grades</li>
                    <img src='../img/learning/ideation_grades.jpg' />
                </ul>

                <br>
                To determine which UI designs to move forward with, several factors were considered: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>How well do the UI designs address the user tasks?</li> 
                    <li>How well do the designs synergize with the designs of the other task categories?</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Based on the design factors mentioned above, the individual UI designs were selected and weaved together into a coherent wireframe sketch. 
                <br><br>
                    <img src='../img/learning/wireframe.jpeg' />
                <br><br>
                The syllabus and progress pages were combined into a single page. The rationale behind this design decision was that many of the requested user tasks were similar to one another and could thus accomplished in a unified, hybrid design layout with hybrid elements from both former pages.
                <br><br>
                The top section shows a description of the course and an overview of the students' progress and grades, so students can instantly see an high-level picture of how they're doing in the course.
                <br><br>
                The user can also see a breakdown of the chapters they're currently working as well as the ones they finished and yet to finish. Chapters in progress are placed towards the top so that users can see them first.
                <br><br>
                Progress was chosen to be represented using "x of y" and grades using "x%" to help differentiate them from  one another. Moreover, the progress' fractions were meant to emphasize current completion, while the grades' percentages were meant to reflect traditinonal grading systems.
                </span>
                <span class='heading'>Peer Review and Design Critique</span>
                <span class='body'>After the wireframes were created, a peer review and design critique were conducted with internal team members to gather input on the initial designs. 
                <br><br>
                To present the wireframes to my peers, the user tasks were first introduced, and then explanations were given regarding how the user tasks could be completed in the wireframe design.
                <br><br>
                The main pieces of feedback were:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The additive grading system seemed discouraging- grades start at 0% and increase towards 100% after completing assignments</li>
                    <li>The grading distribution between homework grades and exam grades isn't clear</li>
                    <li>Chapter weighting should be shown more accurately- percentage grades for each chapter do not show weighted grade values; e.g. chapters with more homeworks should be weighted more heavily</li>
                    <li>Expanded chapter content would be too extensive in most realistic circumstances and would thus make the dropdown interfaces very long</li>
                </ul>
                </span>
                <span class='heading'>Updated Design</span>
                <span class='body'>Based on the feedback from the internal evaluation sessions, several changes were made to the design.
                <br><br>
                <!-- The wireframes were promptly moved forwards towards high-fidelity design using the MongoDB University design system due to project timeline constraints. 
                <br><br> -->
                The updated design changes that were implemented were:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replaced the overall grade percentage with a data visualization that showed grading category breakdowns, which was homework as 50% and the exam as 50%</li>
                    <li>Replaced the chapter grade percentages with correct and incorrect badges to show the graded weight; i.e. more badges for a chapter means greater impact on the overall grade</li>
                    <li>Removed the accordion dropdown and changed the interaction of clicking on a chapter to navigating to the course page itself, which already shows an outline of the chapter</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Next, the mockups were connected together to create <a target="_blank" href="https://mongodb.invisionapp.com/share/5AN4DGQNFKS#/screens">an Invision prototype, which can be accessed here.</a>
                <br><br>

                    </a>
                <br>
                </span>
                <span class='heading'>User Testing</span>
                <span class='body'>
                After creating the prototype based on the updated designs, user testing was conducted with 11 external users, who consisted of both database administrators and developers.  The main goals of the user testing were to:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine whether users would be able to complete the user tasks</li>
                    <li>Gather any other input they may have, such as whether the user tasks accurately reflect their needs and goals</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The user testing methods used included: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Think aloud task walkthrough</li>
                    <li>Follow-up interviews</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Users were given a scenario as context and then asked to perform tasks in the prototype based on the scenario.
                An example of a task scenario was having the user imagine that they have a busy schedule and then asking them to try to determine the amount of coursework they need to finish by a certain deadline.
                <br><br>
                After each of these tasks, users were asked follow-up questions about their decision making.
                <br><br>
                The results were analyzed, and the main user testing insights were:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users could tell what the course was about, but would still like a brief written description of the course instead of having to inspect the chapter titles</li>
                    <li>Users had trouble determining how the course's total duration</li>
                    <li>Only about half of the users understood the overall grade visualization</li>
                    <li>Users liked the badge visualization for graded lessons because they could see the number of graded lessons and the current grade of each lesson</li>
                    <li>Users expected to receive about a recommendation of next steps after completing a course, such as taking another related course or reading related documentation</li>
                </ul>
                </span>
                <span class='heading'>Updated Design</span>
                <span class='body'>
                Based on the user testing results, several design iterations were made: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a course description to the top overview section so that users can read a brief summary of the course</li>
                    <li>Added the course duration to the overview section before a course has begun, so users can determine a course's time commitment without having to browse each chapter's dates and calculate the total duration</li>
                    <li>Replaced the semi-circle grade visualization with a bar chart, which features clear titles for the grading categories- homeworks and the exam</li>
                    <li>Unified the tooltip styles under a commonly used tooltip style from the MongoDB design system</li>
                    <li>Added recommendations for similar courses and related readings for users who have completed the course</li>
                </ul>
