                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Problem</span>
                <span class='body'>Stock trading can seem very daunting. When first starting out, new users may feel overwhelmed by the number of graphs, charts, and financial concepts.
                <br><br>
                This project attempts to address the learning barrier for stock trading. More specifically, how can beginners be introduced to stocks in simple and intuitive way?</span>
                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Research</span>
                <span class='body'>Preliminary research showed that the stock market is generally affected by three factors: fundamental factors, technical factors, and market sentiment.
                <br>
                Based on interviews with traders of all levels, it was revealed that:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fundamental and technical factors typically require extensive background knowledge to fully understand</li>
                    <li>Market sentiment was thought to be the easiest of the three to understand: if many people act on a belief that a stock is going to do very well, it's likely for its price to rise</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                As a result, the direction of the project shifted to creating an intuitive tool for presenting market sentiment data with the intent of familiarizing beginner traders with a relatively simple yet pervasive concept in stock trading.
                <br></span>
                <span class='heading'>Early Design</span>
                <span class='body'>The early design focused on creating a minimum viable product. The process of absorbing market sentiment data was split into two main user tasks: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Searching for a stock</li>
                    <li>Understanding the sentiment rating</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <span id="rating_explanation" onclick="explain_rating()""><i>Click to learn more about the sentiment rating system.</i></span>
                <img id="sketch" onclick="summon(this.id)" src="../img/Sentiment/Sketch.jpg" />
                <img id="early_wireframe" onclick="summon(this.id)" src="../img/Sentiment/Early_Wireframe.png" />
                <img id="early_mockup" onclick="summon(this.id)"src="../img/Sentiment/Early_Mockup.png" /></span>
                <span class='heading'>User Testing</span>
                <span class='body'>For testing the early design, both beginner and advanced stock traders were asked to perform a benchmark task of finding sentiment ratings for various stocks. The testing took place on an Invision-based prototype.
                <br><br>
                Observations and feedback from the beginner traders revealed that:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interface felt easy to navigate</li>
                    <li>Difficult to discover sentiment ratings for new companies</li>
                    <li>Minimalistic search bar interface felt too open-ended; some direction would be appreciated</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Moreover, observations and feedback from the expert traders showed that: 
                <br><Br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data was too sparse for their own uses; however, its simplicity would be fitting for casuals
                    <li>Individual sentiment ratings did not tell enough of the story; need more contextual data</li>
                </ul>
                <span class='heading'>Iterated Design</span>
                <span class='body'>In the iterated design, several features were changed and added to address the user testing results: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stocks are browsable by industry categories</li>
                    <li>Two or more stocks' sentiment ratings can be compared side-by-side</li>
                    <li>List of the latest news articles about the stock company be shown</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The intent behind categorizing stocks by industry was to encourage browsing and discovery of new stocks rather than solely looking-up familiar stocks.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, the motivation behind including relevant news articles was to enable interested traders to investigate the source material and make their own judgements.

                <img id="iterated_mockup" onclick="summon(this.id)" src="../img/Sentiment/Iterated_Mockup.png" /></span>
                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Front-End Prototype</span>
                <span class='body'>For rapid prototyping, a basic front-end web prototype was coded using: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript (jQuery)</li>
                    <li>New York Times API</li>
                    <li>IBM Watson Sentiment API</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                When the user searched for a stock, the New York Times API was called and returned several news articles about the stock. These news articles were then fed into the Watson sentiment API to calculate an average sentiment rating.
                <br><br>
                For future iterations, there would be a focus on:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refactoring the code base using Angular or React for better  extendability and management</li>
                    <li>Experimenting with Twitter API to perform sentiment analysis on stock-related tweets</li>
                </ul></span>

This scale was chosen over a tradition 0 to 10 or 0 to 100 scale due to its ability to convey sentiment scores more intuitively. <br><br> In a 0 to 100 scale, high scores are typically interpreted as good and low scores (typically perceived as below 70) as bad. Under this system, a score of 50 or 50% implies a poor score. However, for sentiment rating, 50 would actually mean that the score was perfectly neutral; people have no strong feelings in either direction. As a result, the -1 to 1 range was chosen to minimize misconceptions and support the idea that 0 represents an origin point that aligns with neutral sentiment.";
