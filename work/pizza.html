                <span class="subtitle">Improving the experience of ordering pizza</span>
                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Problem</span>
                <span class='body'>Pizza is one of the most popular foods in Western culture. Thousands of people order pizza every day.
                <br><br>
                While many pizza services have recently updated their app and web interfaces to increase usability and promote sales, there still exists many lingering usability issues which can be improved upon.</span>
                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Research</span>
                <span class='body'>To learn more about the usability issues that users tend to face when ordering pizza online, several people who frequently ordered pizza were interviewed. 
                <br><br>
                In addition, several existing pizza-delivery apps were analyzed in order to take a closer look at their current user experiences. These apps included: Slice, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, and Dominoes.
                <br><br>
                After the interviews and studies were conducted and synthesized, user research and heuristic analysis on the apps suggested that a positive, intuitive pizza-ordering experience typically included:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pictures of food</li>
                    <li>Minimal visual clutter</li>
                    <li>Guided interaction flow with few steps</li>
                    <li>Delivery status tracking</li>
                </ul></span>
                <span class='heading'>Early Design</span>
                <span class='body'>The process of ordering of a pizza was broken down into three tasks: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting the pizza</li>
                    <li>Checking out with food</li>
                    <li>Monitoring the delivery status</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                After creating an overall interaction flow, several features were incorporated to address the usability guidelines from the user testing: 
                <br><br>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Each ingredient listing includes an image of the ingredient</li>
                    <li>An updating image of the pizza with its current toppings is shown in the customization phase</li> 
                    <li>Delivery screen conveys the pizza's status and estimated delivery time.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <img id="sketch" onclick="summon(this.id)" src="../img/Pizza/Sketch.png" />
                <img id="blockframe" onclick="summon(this.id)" src="../img/Pizza/Blockframe.png" />
                <img id="wireframe" onclick="summon(this.id)" src="../img/Pizza/Wireframe.png" /></span>
                <span class='heading'>User Testing</span>
                <span class='body'>After the early design mock ups were created, user testing was conducted to collect feedback from users. A low-fidelity prototype was created using Invision, and users were asked to perform a benchmark task of ordering a specific pizza.
                <br><br>
                For the task, users were split into two groups: one group participated in a think-aloud activity, while the other group performed the activity silently on their own. 
                <br><br>
                Observations and feedback from the user testing revealed:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pictures of ingredients allowed users to quickly identify ingredients</li>
                    <li>Updating pizza image helped users to remember selected toppings</li>
                    <li>Buttons for half-pie ingredients were too closely located together</li>
                    <li>Inability to skip pizza customization slowed down the overall ordering process</li>
                </ul></span>
                <span class='heading'>Iterated Design</span>
                <span class='body'>For the interated design phase, there was a focus on:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Establishing a visual language for interactivity </li>
                    <li> Allowing for more freedom by offering the option to skip through pizza customization</li>
                    <li> Modifying customization buttons to become more accessible</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <img id="iterated" onclick="summon(this.id)" src="../img/Pizza/Iterated.png" />
                <br><br>
                For future design iterations, there would be an emphasis on addressing other common themes from the user testing feedback, such as:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigation flexibility to skip forwards or backwards in the ordering process</li>
                    <li>Increased use of color to improve usability and enjoyment</li>
                    <li>Exploration of in-depth delivery tracking with GPS or live-streaming</li>
                </ul></span>
