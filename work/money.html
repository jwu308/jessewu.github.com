                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Problem</span>
                <span class='body'>
                Many adolescences often find themselves suddenly flung into the adult world of financial independence. One of challenges of becoming financially independent is learning to manage one's personal finances.</span>
                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Research</span>
                <span class='body'>To learn more about the challenges of becoming financially independent, several young adults were interviewed. After analysis of the interviews, it was found that many young adults often:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Underestimate their expected monthly spendings, leading to overspending</li>
                    <li>Maintain a general idea of their spendings, but do not formally record their spending activity in detail</li>
                    <li>Believe that keeping track of their spending activity seems time-consuming and troublesome</li> 
                </ul>
                </span>
                <span class='heading'>Design</span>
                <span class='body'>As a result of the research, the project goal became to create a user experience that helps young adults to track their spending activity in an intuitive, hassle-free way
                <br><br>
                Moreover, the project was designed for a mobile app to encourage frequent, on-the-go usage. Ideally, users would easily record their transactions and monitor their overall spending throughout the day.
                <br><br>
                Managing spending activity was split into two main user tasks: monitoring past spending and adding recent transactions. When opening the app, users first see an overview of their spending. The total amount spent, spending trends, and amount spent per spending category are displayed. Moreover, if the user would like to epxlore their spending history in detail, they're able to navigate to history screen that shows all transactions indidually.
                <br><br>
                In addition, it was important to make recording transactions feel effortless and streamedlined in order to encourage usage throughout the day. The process of adding a transaction was split into 2 simple steps: selecting a spending category and then entering the amount spent. Ideally, this process would take no longer than a minute. However, if the users desires to add more details to their transaction for documentation purposes, they're able to record a description and time log.
