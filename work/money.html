                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Problem</span>
                <span class='body'>
                Many adolescences often find themselves suddenly flung into the adult world of financial independence. One of challenges of becoming financially independent is learning to manage one's personal finances.</span>
                <br>
                <span class='heading'>Research</span>
                <span class='body'>To learn more about the challenges of becoming financially independent, several young adults were interviewed. After analysis of the interviews, it was found that many young adults often:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Underestimate their expected monthly spendings, leading to overspending</li>
                    <li>Maintain a general idea of their spendings, but do not formally record their spending activity in detail</li>
                    <li>Believe that keeping track of their spending activity seems time-consuming and troublesome</li> 
                </ul>
                </span>
                <span class='heading'>Design</span>
                <span class='body'>As a result of the research, the project goal became to create a user experience that helps young adults track their spending activity in an intuitive, hassle-free manner. 
                <br><br>
                Managing one's spending activity was categorized into two main tasks: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitoring past spending activity</li>
                    <li>Recording recent transactions</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                When opening the app, users first see a spending overview, which displays: 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total amount spent</li>
                    <li>Spending trends over time</li>
                    <li>Amount spent for each spending category, such as food, gas, or entertainment</li> 
                </ul>
                <br>
                If users would like to explore their spending history in detail, they're able to navigate to history screen that shows a list of individual transactions.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, it was important recording transactions to feel effortless and streamlined in order to encourage usage throughout the day. The process of recording a transaction was simplified into two short steps:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting a spending category</li>
                    <li>Entering the amount spent</li> 
                </ul>
                <br>
                Ideally, recording a transaction would take no longer than a minute. The user can also add additional information, such as a description of the purchase and a time log.
                <br><br>
                Finally, the project was designed for a mobile app platform to facilitate frequent, on-the-go usage. Ideally, users would be able to easily record their transactions and monitor their overall spending as they go about their day.
